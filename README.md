#### Stretch Goals:
- **Public/Private Books**:
   - Users can mark books as public or private.
   - Public books are viewable by all users without needing to log in.
   - Private books are only visible to the user who created them.
   
- **Simulated Book Purchases**:
   - Users can add books to a cart and simulate purchasing them.
   - No real transaction will occur, but the UI will allow users to add items to the cart and check out.
